# Case Interview Preparations
My preparations for an upcoming interview with BCG.

## Why this repository?
I have been struggling a little in finding good, free, and solved cases. Therefore, I am creating this repository to help future candidates in finding complete, solved cases.

## Case Interview Structure
It is a 45 minute interview divided into the following divisions.

### Part 1: Background
In this part, the interview will spend 10 to 15 minutes asking you about your background. There are some common questions that you'll be asked and I will provide some of the general questions and answers that you need to prepare for.

### Part 2: The "Case"
This is the fun part :D. Here, you will be provided with a case that you need to crack. It should be about 25 minutes I will provide some of my preparations for this section, including some personal tips and solved cases.

### Part 3: Your turn to ask questions
Here, you have the chance to ask some questions. If you're like me, I am already thinking of what kind of questions should I ask and which ones would make me look smart :D. So, I will also provide some sample questions so that we all look smart.
