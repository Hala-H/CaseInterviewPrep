# Case Interview Preparations
My preparations for an upcoming interview with BCG.

## Why this repository?
I have been struggling a little in finding good, free, and solved cases. Therefore, I am creating this repository to help future candidates in finding complete, solved cases.

## Case Interview Structure
It is a 45 minute interview divided into the following divisions.

### Part 1: Background (PEI)
In this part, the interview will spend 10 to 15 minutes asking you about your background. There are some common questions that you'll be asked and I will provide some of the general questions and answers that you need to prepare for.


### Part 2: The "Case"
This is the fun part :D. Here, you will be provided with a case that you need to crack. It should be about 25 minutes I will provide some of my preparations for this section, including some personal tips and solved cases.

These are the steps you need to follow to solve any case:
#### Recap
Recap the case prompt by summarizing the key points and paraphsrasing.
#### Clarification 
Ask some questions to clarify that you properly understand the case and the objectives and to make sure that you and the interviewer are on the same page.
##### Types of questions you can ask:
<a href = "https://hackingthecaseinterview.thinkific.com/courses/take/consulting/lessons/6142529-2-3-asking-clarifying-questions"> Reference </a>
<ul>
  <li> Asking for a definition you are unfamiliar with </li>
  <li> Asking for information that strengthens your understanding of the company or problem </li>
  <li> Asking questions that clarify the objective of the case</li>
  <li> Asking to repeat information you may have missed </li>  
</ul>
<p> If you cannot think of an intelligent question to ask, it is better not to ask anything. Asking bizarre questions might alarm your interviewer about your critical thinking skills. </p>

#### Framework
It is the most difficult part. You need to structure you solution properly. The most common examples of frameworks include Profitability and Market Aquisition.

#### Analysis
Here, you need to hypothesize and then based on that dive into each of the parts of your framework. In this part, you are expected to perform some quantitative and qualitative analysis, so you can ask for data. You will need basic math to perform some calculations. Remember, a calculator is never allowed in a case interview!

#### Wrap Up and Recommendations
Here, you summarize your findings and provide some suggestions based on your results. Some interviewers might ask you for the next steps such as cost vs revenue analysis, further analysis of the market, etc.

### Part 3: Your turn to ask questions
Here, you have the chance to ask some questions. If you're like me, I am already thinking of what kind of questions should I ask and which ones would make me look smart :D. So, I will also provide some sample questions so that we all look smart.

There are two categories of questions you should ask:
<ul>
  <li> Asking personalized questions focused on the interviewer </li>
  <li> Asking intelligent questions focused on consulting or the firm </li>
</ul>

Examples of personalized questions:
- Looking back at your first year in consulting, what would you have done differently?
- How did you become interested in consulting?
- What do you enjoy the most and the least about your job?
- How did you choose the industry or specialty that you are currently in?

Examples of intelligent firm based questions:
- What are attributes or qualities of the most successful consultants?
- What advice would you give to an incoming consultant?
- What do you think are the biggest misconceptions about consulting?
- Iâ€™m really interested in [specific industry, function, or program], can you speak to the opportunities to get more involved?
