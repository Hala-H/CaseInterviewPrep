<h1> Case Prompt </h1>

<p> Our client is MicroTechnos, retailer that sells electronic accessories in the US. They have been losing money in the past year.
  The CEO wants us to figure out why they are losing money and what they should do about it. Is that correct </p>
  
<h3>Recap and Clarifications </h3> 
  <p> So, before we dive in, I would like to ask a question. When you say they are losing money, do you mean profits have gone down, or profitability have gone down? </p>
  
  <p> Note: </p>
  <p>  Profit is the measure of how much money a company takes in overtime. Profitability is the measurement of the return on investment. A profitable company might not be making any profit. 
  This is because it's reinvesting all its earnings to grow larger. 
The difference between profitability and profit is that profitability measures the long-term health of a company. Profit is more short-term. 
  This definition can also say that profit focuses on bottom-line income while profitability measures the return on investment.</p>
  
  <p> Thank you for your answer. So, profits are going down. One more follow up question.
Is MicroTechnos a large national chain, or is it a smaller player in the industry? </p>
<p> Okay so, it is a national electronic retailer with stores all aound the US. </p>

<p> Thank you. To recap, our client is MicroTechnos, a large national electronics retailer with stores
all around the US. They have recently noticed that their profits are declining so they reached out to us and
want us to: 1) Find out the root cause of the declining profits and 2) Find out what they can do about it.
Is my understanding of the problem correct? </p>

<h3>Framework</h3> 

<p> Alright, so I would like to ask you for a couple of minutes to structure my problem and develop a framework
  to tackle the issue together and reach a promising solution. Is that okay? </p>
  
 <p> Based on my understanding, we know that profits depend on revenue and costs. I would like to explore each branch
  and break it down to smaller segments. I am leaning towards starting with the branch of revenues since it is a large company with multiple branches.
  I am assuming that some branches are not performing well and they are not meeting annual goals.
  Therefore, I would like to look at revenues initially for determining the root cause of declining profits. </p>
  
  <p> Whereas for the what actions does our client need to do to tackle the issue. I would like to look at
three more aspects:
  <ul>
    <li> The customer preferences: did the preferences change, do they not find what they need, are we not keeping up with the new technologies? </li>
    <li> The competitors: do they offer something different, how are their prices, have new competitors joined the industry? </li>
    <li> The market/industry: is this decline in profit associated with a decline in the demand in the market, should we consider a new distribution plan such as online stores? </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p> Therefore, I would like to start with the first aspect as I mentioned before which is the drivers of profit, 
  or more specifically the revenues. So do we have any data about the pricing and the quanitity? I am asking to see if there any recent changes that could have triggered
the decline in profits. </p>

<h3>Analysis</h3> 

<p> Interesting! So you are saying that costs have been roughly the same and I was correct in choosing revenues. Also, the prices has not changes but the quantities did. </p>

<p> Okay sounds good. Which quantities did actually change, as I know we have three major products we sell? </p>

<p> So you're saying we are seeing the steepest decline in laptops. So we can conclude that the cause for the decline in profits is revenues
  and specifically the quantity of sales of laptops. </p>
 
 <p> Hmm, I guess it makes sense to move to the qualitative part of my framework to find out why the sales of laptops have been decreaing.
  So do we know why the laptops sales have been decreasing. Is it maybe related to the customer preferences? Do we have any data about that? </p>

  <p> Wow. Based on the survey responses, it is clearly obvious that people are not interested in buying laptops this year.
3 years ago laptops were the favorite at 15,000 and the number only increased 1000 this year. The trend has moved into
buying tablets as the numbers have increased almost 3 times. Even desktops have increased 2,000 which is interesting to me since people no longer used
desktops as before but maybe the responders were companies. </p>

<p> Interviewer Question: Let's say that MicroTechno would like take advantage from the increase in Tablets purchases.
The best way to do this is to determine the market size for tablets. How would you go about calculating this? </p>

<p> Can we compare the tablet market size with the laptop market size? </p>
<p> So the laptop market size is $30B which is more almost double the tablet's. It is 40% of the laptop's market size.
I assume that it is an attractive market to enter. Do we have any information about the profit margin of tablets and laptops?
Alright, so 25% for laptops and 30% for tablets. This supports my hypothesis. </p>

<p> The interviewer gives the following and asks for insights: </p>

<p> Based on this chart, it seems like the main competitor holds 10% of the market and the other competitos
hold 5% each. The majority of the market share goes to other non-competitor retailers. This implies that the market is
fragmented and there is room for our client for playing in it. I also assume that there are low barriers to entry</p>

<p>Interviwer: What examples of barriers of entry can you give me? </p>

<h3>Recommendations and conclusion</h3> 

<p> Alright so these are the recommendations. </p>

<p>For the next steps, I would like to look at MicroTechnos capabilities of selling tablets. Do they have the expertees, finance, and power to enter such market.
I would also like to perfrom a cost vs revenue analysis to make sure that we would be profitable in entering the market. </p>
