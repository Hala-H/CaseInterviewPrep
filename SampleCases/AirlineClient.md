<h2>My approach: </h2>

<p> Thank you for this very interesting case and I am glad I have the chance to solve it. I will start by recapping
  the case and ask some clarifying questions, just to make sure we're on the same page. Then, I will announce my approach.
  Is that okay? </p>
  
<p> So our client is an airline company who is worried about their fluctuating revenue streams. 
  They are asking us to help them level out the fluctuations in their revenues. Am I correct? </p>
  
  <p> I would like to ask some questions, if possible. </p>
  <ul>
  <li> How long has the fluctuations been going on? Is it something recent or has it been going for long? </li>
  <li> Are we concerned with specific revenue streams such as passengers, cargo fees, or other services? Or are we looking at it in general? </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p> Thank you. May I take a couple of minutes to structure my approach? </p>
  
  <p> So the factors that I belive we can look into are the different revenue streams and try to determine if it the fluctuations come from a specific segment or not.
  We can also explore the revenues including the costs per unit and the volume </p>
  
  <p> Do we have any data about the costs of the tickets, cargo, or other services? </p>
  <p> Do we have information about the sales such as the number of tickets sold and so on? </p>
  
  <p> My approach is the following. Since we are concerned with revenues, we need to investigates the costs an the sales. 
We can start by doing some math with the costs and then the volume. This would help us determine which part of the equation is our problem.
Then, we isolate the cause and explore it further until we reach a certain hypothesis. It could be one of the two:
Either we decrease our cost or we increase our volume. </p>
